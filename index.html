        <h1 class="mb-3">Tori Kim
        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Political Science/International Affairs Major</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Tori Kim is a 19 year old educator, studying Political Science with an International Affairs concentration at the University of California, Riverside. She is currently a 2nd year in the College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences about to go into her 3rd chapter this 2021. Tori is an aspiring children's and youth's educator and activist; she has had both professional and personal experiences in working with young students particularly around the subject of English language and composition. Tori is also trilingual, as she loves language in general; she speaks fluent English, proficient Hangul dialect for the Korean language, and is working on improving her proficiency in Spanish. She hopes to learn more languages in the future, along with the diverse and rich cultures that are associated with it. Tori looks forward to safe and healthy traveling in the later years in a more post-COVID era.<br><br>

       Being a student has been Tori's status as long as she can remember, and it is not something she considers a temporary occupation. She hopes to continue to empower student voices and mostly focus on lending youth a bigger, better platform as she works in her future. A little cheesy, but Tori equates being a student to being a 'lifelong learner', which is not something she considers very lightly. Being a student is all she has ever known, and she particularly is passionate about improving the quality of education and accessibility in the academic world for all students, particularly here in the U.S. At UCR, she has been a long-standing member of GCAP (Green Campus Action Plan), a student-led sustainability organization which is one of the facets of her emphasis on student-led, student-organized activism and amplification of young voices. She served two years as both a committee member and later, a paid position as Programming Director. Throughout her youth, she has been part of the WE Movement seeking to tutor primary education-level students in English, and has privately tutored her own family and recommended friends at home. In general, Tori has always had a passion towards working with children and empowering the role and voice they have in education as a whole.<br><br>

      Tori is most vocal and passionate towards the empowerment, quality, and improvement of both children's and youth's education and, even health because she has witnessed and experienced different levels of care and platform as a young student herself. Most importantly, she has consistently, actively thought about how different educational programs and health services as well as the accessibility to both, have impacted young generations' abilities to learn, succeed, and grow. Personally, Tori has advocated for better mental health services, accessibility, and even education about mental illnesses for her generation and those upcoming, because she understands the pressure and struggle to juggle both school and mental health. Writing poetry and mini essays became her outlet throughout school, as Tori has a passion for language, literature, and student empowerment, which came altogether when she submitted and lent her artistry to platforms such as popular poetry accounts online. This is the kind of channel and voice she wants her counterparts to have as well, as she too well understands how powerful it can be for a young student.
